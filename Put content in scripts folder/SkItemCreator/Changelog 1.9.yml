-- SkItemCreator can now save the NBT of blocks you place!
  - You need to add 'save-nbt: true' in your item .yml. Only works if your item is a block.
  - It means that when your block is placed, the block will keep the NBT and will drop the item back when broken!
  - One downside is that blocks that have this setting true can't be pushed by pistons. Please not that because minecraft
    does not natively support nbt for blocks, don't use blocks that can be changed by physics or other things. For example,
    don't use grass because it can become dirt.
  - This feature supports explosions, meaning that exploded blocks will drop the correct item.
  - Added option 'self-drop' (true/false). False will not drop the block when broken.

-- Added 'item-category' option for items. 
  - Useful for sorting items. Can be used for class items, talismans...

-- Added 'potion-color' option for potions. Value must be HEX.

-- Added 'potion-effects' option for potions. Pattern: <effect>:<duration>:<amplifier>

-- Added 'DRAG_AND_DROP' event for mythic-skills and skript-effects.

-- Added 'BLOCK-BREAK' event for mythic-skills which was missing.

-- Added 'BREAK' event which IS NOT THE SAME as 'BLOCK-BREAK'. 'BREAK' only works if your item is a block.
   It will be triggered when your block is broken by a player, unlike 'BLOCK-BREAK' which is triggered when
   breaking a block with your item.

-- Added 'chance' option for skript-effects and mythic-skills. From 0 to 100. 

-- Added placeholders for skript-effects!
  - You can now use {clicked-item} as a placeholder for the clicked item (useful for events involving a clicked item)
  - Also added {victim}, {attacker}, {event-block}, {clicked-entity}, {clicked-block}, {event-item}, {clicked-slot}

-- Fixed a bug with skript-effects not triggering sometimes.

-- Set /skic gui as the default command if the first argument is not set.

-- New functions:

  - SKICItemCategoryOf(item)
    - Returns the 'item-category' flag of an item.
    - Example: SKICItemCategoryOf(tool of player)

  - SKICAllItemsOfCategory(category)
    - Returns a list with all items with the category flag provided.
    - Example: broadcast SKICAllItemsOfCategory("TALISMANS")

  - SKICSetDisabledBehavior(itemid, behaviors)
    - Set the disabled behaviors of an item id.
    - Useful if you're creating a script that interacts with SkItemCreator.
    - Example: SKICSetDisabledBehavior("my_apple", "CONSUME")

  - SKICGetPlacedBlock(block)
    - Returns the internal name of a block. Only works if 'save-nbt' is true in its config file.

-- Added 'midas_bookshelf' and 'midas_book' as examples of the new features.
